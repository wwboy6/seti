# Copilot: Vue SFC Format
When generating or editing a .vue file:
- Place HTML in the <template> section.
- Place JavaScript/TypeScript in the <script> or <script setup> section.
- Place CSS in the <style> section.
Never mix content between these sections. Always insert new code into the correct tag.
